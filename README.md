# Jokes API

This is a REST API built with Node.js, Express, and Prisma. It provides endpoints for accessing a database collection of dad jokes. Authenticated users can add jokes to a personal list of favorites. Authenticated admins can also add or remove jokes from the database, and remove users.

## üíª Running Locally

#### Assumptions

1. Postgres is running locally
2. Node is installed locally (v18^)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a .env file in the project root directory, modeled on the included `.env.sample`
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npm run db:model` to generate the prisma models.
5. Run `npm run db:build` to apply the database migrations.
6. Run `npm run db:seed` to seed the database with sample data.
7. Run `npm run build` to compile the Typescript code after passing all Jest tests.
8. Run `npm run start` to start the API server.

### Testing

Run `npm test` to run automated local tests and generate a coverage report. After running tests, run `npm run report` to view the coverage report in a browser.

Jest test suites are also run prior to build, and will cause the build to fail if any tests fail or code coverage falls below the minimum threshold configured in `jest.config.js`.

A suite of Postman API tests has been created to send a full suite of live http requests to the local server. Run `npm run postman:test` to start this test suite. An API key is required -- ask Justin if you would like it shared with you for testing.
